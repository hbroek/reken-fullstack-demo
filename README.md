# reken-fullstack-demo
See Reken in action with our dynamic demo CRUD web application. Master GET, POST, DELETE, PUT REST calls with Python Flask REST service. Efficiently manage SQLite database tasksâ€”fetch, create, delete, update rows. Enhance UI with Tailwind styling. Ideal for developers aiming to use Reken for effective web app development.

## Run instructions
Clone repo to local environment.
```bash
# Start a terminal
git clone https://github.com/hbroek/reken-fullstack-demo.git
cd reken-fullstack-demo
```

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed. Then install the following packages:
```bash
#In terminal
pip install flask
pip install db-sqlite3 # if you don't have sqlite installed, typically shipped with python3
pip install flask-cors #only when using cors. REST API and Web App need to run on different domain/port. Not applicable for instructions below.
```

After packages are installed, go to the src
```bash
cd src
python3 rest_employees.py # Start the Flask server and the web server and REST end points
```
